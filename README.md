# Canadian Banks Stock Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the stock performance of major Canadian banks over a specified period. By examining historical stock data, we seek to uncover trends, assess volatility, and provide insights that can inform investment decisions.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains the raw and processed datasets used for analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data cleaning, exploration, and analysis processes.
- **dashboard/**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards presenting key findings.
- **reports/**: Generated reports summarizing the analysis and insights.

## Data Sources

The primary dataset comprises historical stock prices of the following Canadian banks:

- Bank of Montreal (BMO)
- Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)
- Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM)
- Royal Bank of Canada (RY)
- Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)

Data was sourced from reputable financial databases and includes daily closing prices, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics.

## Dashboard

An interactive dashboard is available to visualize key findings from the analysis. The dashboard provides insights into stock trends, volatility, and comparisons among the banks.

## Key Findings

1. **Stock Performance Trends**: Analysis revealed that all five banks experienced growth in their stock prices over the analyzed period, with notable fluctuations corresponding to major economic events.
2. **Volatility Assessment**: The banks exhibited varying levels of volatility, with some showing more resilience to market downturns than others.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: There is a high positive correlation among the stock prices of these banks, indicating that they often move in tandem, likely due to their exposure to similar market conditions.

## Recommendations

- **Diversification**: Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with sector-specific downturns.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Given the observed volatility, regular monitoring of stock performance is advisable to make timely investment decisions.
- **Further Research**: Additional analysis incorporating macroeconomic indicators could provide deeper insights into factors influencing stock performance.

## Future Enhancements

To build upon this analysis, the following improvements are proposed:

- **Incorporate Dividend Analysis**: Evaluating dividend yields and payout ratios to assess the total return on investment.
- **Expand Dataset**: Including more financial institutions or extending the time frame for a more comprehensive analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models to forecast future stock performance based on historical data.
